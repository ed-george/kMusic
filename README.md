## Thanks 💕

**Huge thanks** to [jMusic](http://explodingart.com/jmusic), especially Andrew Sorensen and Andrew Brown for being the main inspiration behind this library. The continued work they have made on their project for 20 years is an amazing achievement and I personally admire yourselves and the project greatly.

Thanks also to @SteveBarnegren for the project idea based on his [tweets](https://twitter.com/SteveBarnegren/status/1076764800917618688) and his great work on all things Swift. He's a smart cookie.
